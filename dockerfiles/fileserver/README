To build static binaries which run anywhere 
use options:

COG_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -tags netgo -a -v fileserver.go

	-a => rebuild already compiled code
	-v => verbose

The downside of this is an ovbious increase in the size of the binary and significant compile time

# To execute inside docker:

docker run -d -p 1234:8080 -v $(pwd):/data mfrw/fileserver
